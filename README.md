## Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock market trends using historical data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance). It applies machine learning models, including RandomForest, to forecast stock prices, particularly for the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

## Features

Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
Cleans and preprocesses the dataset
Implements RandomForest for price prediction
Visualizes trends using Matplotlib
Evaluates model performance using MSE and R² score

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Market_Pred.ipynb

Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install yfinance numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
